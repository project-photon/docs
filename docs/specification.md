# Specification

v0.0.1, March 01 2021

This is a rough sketch of an actual spec for the Project Photon protocol (PTTP). It is far from complete, so changes to this document may be drastic. You can write code to this pseudo-specification and be confident that it probably won't become totally non-functional due to massive changes next week, but you are still urged to keep an eye on ongoing development of the protocol and make changes as required.

This is just here so that I am able to pen down my thoughts for this document as fast as possible, while letting people know what to expect of the specification.

Any feedback on this is very welcome, please email [raphpb1912@gmail.com](mailto:raphpb1912@gmail.com).
